I am seeking a challenging and research-driven environment where I can develop and make a meaningful contribution. If you are looking to collaborate on a research task, either in academia or in industry, do reach out. I am always happy to participate in interesting new projects!

I graduated with a PhD in Statistics from the [London School of Economics](http://www.lse.ac.uk/), advised by [Kostas Kalogeropoulos](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Dr-Kostas-Kalogeropoulos) and [Pauline Barrieu](http://stats.lse.ac.uk/barrieu/), and funded by the [ESRC](https://esrc.ukri.org/skills-and-careers/doctoral-training/). My doctoral research evolved around the topic of Sequential Bayesian Learning for State Space Models. More generally, I have been working on estimating model parameters in a batch as well as in a times series setting, with a focus on latent variable models.

Before I joined LSE, I obtained a master's degree in [Quantitative Finance](https://www.msfinance.uzh.ch/en.html) from ETH Zurich and University of Zurich. I have work experience in asset management through the excellent [portfolio management program](https://www.cpm.uzh.ch/en.html) during my master's studies, and from internships in the research and portfolio management division at Deutsche Bank/Deutsche Asset Management. 
I have highlighted some of my open source contributions [here](https://paschermayr.github.io/#opensource), and a copy of my CV can be downloaded [here](https://paschermayr.github.io/uploads/resume.pdf).
